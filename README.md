# Counter-App-Using-LocalStorage-JavaScript
This is a simple counter application with save functionality. Here I am using localStorage to save the counter data and display it. So data remain saved whether browser is closed or tab is closed. Unless if the reset all button is pressed or Cache cleaned the data will be saved as it should be.
